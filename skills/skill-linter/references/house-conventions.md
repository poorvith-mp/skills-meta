# House conventions

Enforced mechanically by `scripts/validate.py` in the hub repo. Run it rather
than checking these by hand; this file exists so the linter can explain *why* a
rule exists when it flags something.

```
skill-id/
├── SKILL.md          required; `name` must match the folder name
├── references/       optional; only if there is real lookup content
├── scripts/          optional; executable helpers
└── assets/           optional; templates, schemas, fixtures
```

Do not create placeholder files to fill these folders. An empty `references/`
is worse than no `references/`.

## Description

- **Under 250 characters.** Claude truncates the description in the skill
  listing at roughly that point, so anything past it is invisible at the moment
  the skill is being chosen. A trigger clause at the end of a 400-character
  description does nothing.
- **Capability first, triggers second**, both inside the limit.
- **Never trigger on the skill's own name.** People describe tasks, not skill
  ids. "Use when the user asks about tax strategist" matches nothing.
- **Name the sibling when two skills overlap.** "Not for valuation — use
  `financial-analyst`" is what stops them competing for one request.

## Body

- Imperative instructions, explaining the why behind non-obvious steps.
- Opens with an H1 naming the skill.
- Under ~500 lines; push detail into `references/`.
- **Every file in `references/` must be linked from the body.** Agents load
  reference files only when SKILL.md points at them, so an unlinked reference
  can never be read.
- Verification checklist and anti-patterns must match the skill's domain. The
  archetypes live in `taxonomy/checklists.yaml` in the hub repo — a finance
  skill checks that figures reconcile, not that code compiles.

## Never

- Personal file paths, usernames, machine-specific config, or private URLs.
- Third-party credits or "built by X" content.
- Committed build artifacts (`*.skill` zips) inside the skill folder.
